# ðŸ›’ Blinkit Grocery Sales Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Blinkitâ€™s grocery sales data. It combines **Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to derive meaningful insights regarding customer preferences, sales patterns, and outlet performance.

The approach demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, starting from **data cleaning and exploration** in Python to **business-oriented visualization** in Power BI.

## ðŸ›  Tools and Technologies

* **Python**: Data cleaning, manipulation, and exploratory analysis

  * Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* **Power BI**: Dashboard development and KPI tracking

  * Data modeling, DAX measures, slicers, and filters

---

## ðŸ”Ž Methodology

### Python (Data Cleaning & EDA)

* Handled missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset
* Standardized categorical values (e.g., fat content categories)
* Conducted exploratory analysis:

  * Sales distribution by item type, outlet type, location, and fat content
  * Trend analysis by establishment year
  * Correlation analysis among numerical variables

### Power BI (Dashboard Development)

* Designed an interactive dashboard with filters for outlet size, location, and type
* Created DAX measures for KPI calculations: Total Sales, Average Sales, Ratings, and Item Counts
* Implemented charts for outlet performance, sales by item category, and fat content distribution

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

### From Python Analysis

Low Fat items generated slightly higher sales compared to Regular items.

Medium-sized outlets contributed the highest share of sales (~42%).

Tier 3 locations showed the strongest sales performance.

Outlets established before 2000 recorded the highest sales, while those established after 2010 showed stable but comparatively lower sales.

### From Power BI Dashboard

* **Total Sales**: â‚¹1.20M
* **Total Items**: \~9,000
* **Average Rating**: 3.92
* **Average Sales per Item**: â‚¹141
* **Supermarket Type 1** generated the highest revenue contribution

## ðŸš€ Conclusion

This project illustrates how Python and Power BI complement each other in data analysis:

* **Python** enables detailed exploration, cleaning, and visualization at the dataset level.
* **Power BI** provides executive-ready dashboards with real-time interactivity.

The integration of both approaches results in a **complete analytics solution** useful for decision-making in retail and e-commerce domains.
